# WT-Fonts
These are the fonts and others that I'm working on. (New repository of Hydorus Fonts)
# Chiang Sans - an extended version of Droid Sans Fallback.
With full Unicode 13.0 support, I am still working on the L3 version with Chunom and Sawndip glyphs from Nom Na Tong and Sawndip fonts.
# Jiangeng - an extended version of Builder Sans Medium.
Some glyphs are fallbacked into the Droid Sans font.
# NeaMonternaFont - a geometrical sans inspired by Futura.
